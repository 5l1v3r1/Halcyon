### Description
Halcyon IDE lets you quickly and easily develop Nmap scripts for performing advanced scans on applications and infrastructures with a range from recon to exploitation capabilities. It is the first IDE released exclusively for Nmap script development. Halcyon IDE is free and open source project (always will be) to provide an easier development interface to rapidly growing information security community around the world.

Halcyon IDE was initially started as an evening free time “coffee shop” project and has taken a serious step for its developer/contributors to spend dedicated time for its improvements very actively. Visit contribute page to see how you can join us to help the project’s future improvements.
